# digitrecognizer_kaggle

The arthor managed three methods to solve digit recognizer problem on kaggle. 
One is traditional ensemble machine learning method RandomForestClassifier.
The other two are deep learning methods. CNN & lLSTM. 
All work well.


The data set come from a kaggle get-started competition. which is the same with its counterpart in tensorflow API.
A very good material to practice deep learning & tensorflow manipulation.

Hope you enjoy!
